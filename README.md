# tn3wrepo
A personal project portfolio, similar to GitHub, written in Rust, featuring Markdown rendering and syntax highlighting for all your coding endeavors.

This can also found on my own repo: [repo.tn3w.dev/tn3wrepo](https://repo.tn3w.dev/tn3wrepo).

## Why?  
- **Privacy concerns**: Platforms like GitHub collect extensive metadata on user activity, including commits, pull requests, and interactions.  
- **AI training on user code**: Large platforms use publicly available code to train AI models, often without explicit user consent.  
- **Potential NSA involvement**: As a U.S.-based service, GitHub could be subject to government surveillance or data requests.  
- **Censorship and control**: GitHub has a history of restricting or taking down repositories based on legal or political reasons.  
- **Self-sovereignty**: Hosting your own portfolio ensures full control over your projects, visibility, and accessibility without reliance on a third party.

Cool.
